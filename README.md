The weather icons are limited. And it was a lot of work to map each icon. So I have grouped them based on Clouds, Rain, Thunderstorm, Snow, Drizzle, Clear, Sunny.

## Development 
- install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- install dependencies with `$ npm install`
- run `$ grunt watch` to process changes file
